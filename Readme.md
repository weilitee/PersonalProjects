This interactive dashboard analyzes crime trends in Minneapolis from 2019 to 2025 using publicly available incident data. The dashboard explores patterns in neighborhood-level crime, types of offenses, and overall changes over time.

### 🔍 Key Features:
1. **KPI Summary** – Displays the overall change in crime rate compared to the baseline year (2019), with visual indicators showing increase or decrease.
2. **Incident Filter** – A global filter allows users to focus on specific crime types (e.g., Auto Theft, Robbery), updating all visualizations and KPIs accordingly.
3. **Neighborhood View** – Highlights crime counts by neighborhood to identify potential hotspots.
4. **Trend Analysis** – Shows how crime levels have changed over the years using a time-series chart.
5. **Crime Type Breakdown** – Compares the most common incident categories and how their frequencies have shifted over time.

This dashboard was created and published using Tableau Public as part of a portfolio project. The full data cleaning and preparation process can be reviewed in the linked Kaggle notebook above.


# Project 2
## Title: Product Costing & Margin Analysis (Mock Retail Dataset)
### Tools: SQL, Tableau

This interactive dashboard analyzes product profitability and cost structure using a mock retail dataset. The goal of the project is to identify which product categories and individual SKUs drive profitability, which ones underperform, and how tariff changes could impact overall margins. The dashboard provides financial and pricing insights to support decision-making around pricing strategy, cost control, and product portfolio management.

### 🔍 Key Features:

1. **KPI Summary** – Displays overall margin, total revenue, and profit with clear indicators for quick performance assessment.
2. **Category Analysis** – Compares margins across product categories to highlight the most profitable areas.
3. **Worst-Performing Products** – Identifies the bottom 15 products by profit margin, allowing focus on underperforming SKUs.
4. **Scenario Analysis: Tariff Impact** – Models how margins shift when tariffs increase, with an adjustable slider for testing different scenarios.
5. **Interactive Filtering** – Enables filtering by product category and dynamic parameter adjustment, updating all KPIs and visualizations in real time.

This dashboard was created and published using Tableau Public as part of a portfolio project. It demonstrates skills in KPI design, profitability analysis, scenario modeling, and professional dashboard development.
