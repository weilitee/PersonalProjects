This interactive dashboard analyzes crime trends in Minneapolis from 2019 to 2025 using publicly available incident data. The dashboard explores patterns in neighborhood-level crime, types of offenses, and overall changes over time.

### 🔍 Key Features:
1. **KPI Summary** – Displays the overall change in crime rate compared to the baseline year (2019), with visual indicators showing increase or decrease.
2. **Incident Filter** – A global filter allows users to focus on specific crime types (e.g., Auto Theft, Robbery), updating all visualizations and KPIs accordingly.
3. **Neighborhood View** – Highlights crime counts by neighborhood to identify potential hotspots.
4. **Trend Analysis** – Shows how crime levels have changed over the years using a time-series chart.
5. **Crime Type Breakdown** – Compares the most common incident categories and how their frequencies have shifted over time.

This dashboard was created and published using Tableau Public as part of a portfolio project. The full data cleaning and preparation process can be reviewed in the linked Kaggle notebook above.
